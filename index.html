  <h2>About me </h2>
  <p>I am a girl who codes from Edison, NJ. I will be in the 11th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to the social aspects of school. I am on the Varsity track team in my school; I run long distances (I do the 800s and 1600s) and I play soccer on my jv team. I live at home with my mom, my dad, my brothers and sisters, there are 7 of us (kids). When I am not coding, you can find me listening to music or posting on my finsta. My favorite color is blue and I like watching reality tv shows like 90 day fiance and little women. I am easily entertained but at the same time I am not. My music taste is really spaced out I could be listening to Sza one minute then listening to New Edition and listening to Ybn Nahmir the next minute.</p>

  <p> Likes: I like singing, I love rap music and drawing. Ybn Nahmir is my favorite  slaughter-gang/trap rapper and Drake is my favorite pop rapper. 90s fashion and recreating and designing my own variations and take on this decade fashion is a favorite of mine.</p>

  <p>Dislikes: I  do not like peanut butter or nutella. I am allergic to the former and I find the latter gross in general. I do not like animals (Dogs, Cats and all those). I do not vibe with animals, they make me uncomfortable.

  Fun Fact: I was born in Africa and my finsta name is about my nationality.
  I've lived in 2 continents before I moved to America, and I was supposed to go to boarding school this year.</p>
